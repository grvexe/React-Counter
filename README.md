What does this project do?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• React Counter is a program that has a text and 3 buttons. The buttons increase, decrease and reset the count of the
text. The counter starts with the number 0 and it can increase or decrease depending on the input. It can also 
display negative numbers. If the count displays a number that is divisble by 10 then the background colour changes.
